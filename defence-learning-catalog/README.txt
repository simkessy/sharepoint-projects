In this proejct I took an infopath document library and turned the results into a repository for various classes (IP Forms).
I presented the results using the preview style for lists and added URL filtering through dropped down boxes.
I used SPServices to retrieve options for the dropdown and appand the results to the URL.
I also added Instant filtering on the results so when the user starts typing results are filtered down
