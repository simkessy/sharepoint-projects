These files contain web pages which aggregated various SharePoint artifacts such as lists, calendars, files, surveys, document sets, discussion boards and aggregated them into a single interactive page that allowed users to manipulate each aartifiact within a single location. 

I also provided a simple instant search that allowed users to quickly find projects and reach that projects dashboard without having to go through the list 

There's also an activity feed that displayed the top 15 most recently created forms, files and events.
