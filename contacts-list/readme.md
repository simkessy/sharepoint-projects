This project revolved around returning a list of contacts for each team within an organization. 
There is 1 contacts list. There's a drop down to identify which team each contact belongs too
There are X teams and each team has a logo image. 

When the page loads, the script grabs the page name (Team 1.aspx) as a variable
It them uses that variable to retrieve the contacts in the matching team as well at the team logo with the same name
